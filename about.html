        <h4>History</h4>
        <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi River in
            what is now
            lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men celebrated it as
            part of an
            observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans is
            unknown. A 1730
            account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including
            cross-dressing).[2]
            An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and wearing of
            masks in the
            streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed whenever
            such
            restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.</p>

        <h4>Traditional Colors</h4>
        <p>
            The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are purple, green, and gold. The colors
            were first
            specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade in 1872,
            suggesting that
            balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen; some
            accounts
            suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true
            symbolism.[38][39]

            Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a theory that the
            colors were
            based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's goal may have been to
            create a tricolor
            to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was already heavily
            used on other
            national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in that
            order complies
            with the rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next to other
            colors, and
            that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.[38]

            Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats themed
            around the
            concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that order symbolized
            justice, power, and
            faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that orderâ€”even though
            this order
            technically violates the rule of tincture.[38][40]
