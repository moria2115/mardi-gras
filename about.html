                <h4>History</h4>
                <p>The first record of Mardi Gras being celebrated in Louisiana was at the mouth of the Mississippi
                    River in
                    what is now
                    lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, on March 2, 1699. Iberville, Bienville, and their men
                    celebrated it
                    as
                    part of an
                    observance of Catholic practice. The date of the first celebration of the festivities in New Orleans
                    is
                    unknown. A 1730
                    account by Marc-Antoine Caillot celebrating with music and dance, masking and costuming (including
                    cross-dressing).[2]
                    An account from 1743 that the custom of Carnival balls was already established. Processions and
                    wearing
                    of
                    masks in the
                    streets on Mardi Gras took place. They were sometimes prohibited by law, and were quickly renewed
                    whenever
                    such
                    restrictions were lifted or enforcement waned.</p>

                <h4>Traditional Colors</h4>

                <p>
                    The colors traditionally associated with Mardi Gras in New Orleans are purple, green, and gold. The
                    colors
                    were first
                    specified in proclamations by the Rex organization during the lead-up to their inaugural parade in
                    1872,
                    suggesting that
                    balconies be draped in banners of these colors. It is unknown why these specific colors were chosen;
                    some
                    accounts
                    suggest that they were initially selected solely on their aesthetic appeal, as opposed to any true
                    symbolism.[38][39]

                    Errol Laborde, author of Marched the Day God: A History of the Rex Organization, presented a theory
                    that
                    the
                    colors were
                    based on heraldry: all three colors correspond to a heraldic tincture, and Rex's goal may have been
                    to
                    create a tricolor
                    to represent their "kingdom". Purple was widely associated with royalty, while white was already
                    heavily
                    used on other
                    national flags, and was thus avoided. Furthermore, he noted that a flag in green, gold and purple in
                    that
                    order complies
                    with the rule of tincture, which states that metals (gold or silver) can only be placed on or next
                    to
                    other
                    colors, and
                    that colors cannot be placed on or next to other colors.[38]

                    Following a color-themed Rex parade in 1892 that featured purple, green, and gold-colored floats
                    themed
                    around the
                    concepts, the Rex organization retroactively declared that the three colors in that order symbolized
                    justice, power, and
                    faith. The traditional colors are commonly addressed as purple, green, and gold, in that order—even
                    though
                    this order
                    technically violates the rule of tincture.[38][40]

            <h4>Mardi Gras Day</h4>
            <p>
                The celebrations begin early on Mardi Gras Day, which can fall on any Tuesday between February 3 and
                March 9
                (depending
                on the date of Easter, and thus of Ash Wednesday).[45]

                In New Orleans, the Zulu parade rolls first, starting at 8 am on the corner of Jackson and Claiborne and
                ending at Broad
                and Orleans, Rex follows Zulu as it turns onto St. Charles following the traditional Uptown route from
                Napoleon to St.
                Charles and then to Canal St. Truck parades follow Rex and often have hundreds of floats blowing loud
                horns,
                with entire
                families riding and throwing much more than just the traditional beads and doubloons. Numerous smaller
                parades and
                walking clubs also parade around the city. The Jefferson City Buzzards, the Lyons Club, the Irish
                Channel
                Corner Club,
                Pete Fountain's Half Fast Walking Club and the KOE all start early in the day Uptown and make their way
                to
                the French
                Quarter with at least one jazz band. At the other end of the old city, the Society of Saint Anne
                journeys
                from the
                Bywater through Marigny and the French Quarter to meet Rex on Canal Street. The Pair-O-Dice Tumblers
                rambles
                from bar to
                bar in Marigny and the French Quarter from noon to dusk. Various groups of Mardi Gras Indians, divided
                into
                uptown and
                downtown tribes, parade in their finery.

                Mardi Gras!
                <br>
                The Carnival season officially begins each year on Jan. 6 -- the Feast of the Epiphany, also called
                Twelfth
                Night or
                Kings’ Day. Traditional balls are held in the weeks leading up to the big event.
                <br>

                Spectacular parades with colorful, creative floats start rolling before Mardi Gras Day. Our private
                Carnival
                clubs,
                called krewes, take on royalty status and throw beads, doubloons and toys to parade goers. Visitors
                quickly
                learn to
                say, "Throw me something mister!"

                Pleasure Club and
                the Rex Organization parade through the city. Music, food and elaborate costumes add to the fun-filled
                day
                of excitement
                for revelers of all ages.
