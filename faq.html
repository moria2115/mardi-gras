                                No! Mardi Gras is a holiday, just like Christmas and Easter. It belongs to everyone. Do

                                Using
                                the term “official” is
                                just a way for vendors to sell their products or services to those who do not know
                                better.

                                The Carnival season always begins on Jan. 6, which is King’s Day (Feast of the
                                Epiphany).
                                Mardi

                                however, is on a different day each year.

                                Fat Tuesday changes every year because Easter Sunday is never on the same Sunday each
                                year.
                                Fat
                                Tuesday is always the
                                day before Ash Wednesday.

                                Most visitors plan to arrive no later than the Saturday prior to Mardi Gras day and stay
                                through
                                Ash

                                The weather during Mardi Gras can vary from very cold to very warm, almost hot.
                                Sometimes it
                                will
                                change from one
                                extreme to the other during the same day. It’s a good idea to layer your clothes since a
                                chilly
                                morning may turn into a
                                warm afternoon.

                                Since you will be spending long days outside, pack comfortable shoes and clothes that
                                can
                                get
                                somewhat dirty. Don’t
                                forget to check the forecast for rain. If storms are predicted, then you’ll definitely
                                want

                                By all means, yes! Contrary to public perception, Mardi Gras is a family celebration.
                                Those
                                of
                                us
                                who grew up in New
                                Orleans feel guilty once our children have grown up and we continue going to every
                                parade
                                because we
                                used to use "taking
                                the children" as our excuse! Bring big bags (even large garbage bags!) to hold all of
                                the
                                stuff
                                they
                                will catch. Throws
                                often include toys, stuffed animals, beads, and more.

                                The only place you should avoid with kids is the French Quarter (where no full-size
                                parades
                                pass
                                anyway). We recommend
                                seeing the parades when they begin on St. Charles Avenue near Napoleon since parades can
                                last
                                until
                                11 p.m. near the end
                                of the route. The Garden District portion of St. Charles is a family area where you will
                                see
                                many
                                families staking out
                                their parade watching position, having picnics, playing ball, and having fun under the
                                beautiful
                                oak
                                trees. You don't
                                have to worry about the streetcars, as they stop running in this area during Mardi Gras.

                                You may also want to consider taking your kids to the parades in suburban areas like
                                Metairie,
                                which
                                is only 10 minutes
                                away from New Orleans. Metairie's Caesar parade, the Saturday before Mardi Gras weekend,
                                is
                                the
                                parade Disneyworld
                                features on Mardi Gras day. Kids love it!
